# Collating my Kaggle projects 

I'm going to be playing around with the projects and competitions available in Kaggle. I want to improve my use of Github for version control and build some experience in supervised learning tasks.. and do something productive with my time during lockdown.. 

### Competitions
1. Titanic survival prediction: Build a model that predicts the survival of passengers from the Titanic
